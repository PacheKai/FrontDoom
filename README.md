Welcome to FrontDoom! (Name may change in future)
This project aims at creating a GUI/mod manager utility to be used in conjuction with variety of Doom's source ports. Currently, it only works with and supports GZDoom, but in future (hopefully) other source ports will be useable with it aswell.
Project is still early in development, and if someone decides to try it, do so on your own risk!

FrontDoom is built using Python 3.6 with only big non-standard library being PyQt, that powers graphical user interface.
